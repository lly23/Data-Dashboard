Project 3 - Data Dashboard
Goal
Using datasets from reputable sources (e.g., data.gov), create a data-driven dashboard that accurately tells a story or shows breakdowns and collections of the data in a visual way. This dashboard should be a well-designed web application that is interactive and primarily visual. Some amount of text is necessary, of course -- you always need a title and brief introduction, if nothing else -- and some stories require more written material than others. But the interactive charts should be the focus on the piece.

You must emulate the style of a major news publication. A list of suggested outlets is provided below, with links to their style guides. You may choose to emulate a news site not on this list, but if so, you must clear it with me by Friday, October 26, 2018.

Requirements
Responsive design, using either Bootstrap or CSS Grid/FlexBox
Adherence to one of the style guides listed below or the style of your chosen organization's website
At least two (2) charts and one (1) table
Use of XML or JSON data in at least one of the charts
Tasteful use of UI/UX elements to enhance the app (e.g., tooltips, accordion, slider, etc.)
Links to the source data, preferably as captions with the charts, or in a separate list of sources. All of the charts and factual statements in your story should have accurate, specific sources of data. For example, don't just cite 'data.gov;' cite the specific dataset on which you based your chart, e.g. 'U.S. Department of Agriculture 2010 Food Environment Atlas'
Expectations
Your web app should look good enough and work well enough to be published by the news organization that you've chosen to emulate (e.g., if you're following the Washington Post style guide, it should actually look good enough to appear in the Post and be free of any major glitches).

Grading
Code: does it work? Is it clean and efficient? (33.3%)
Design: how closely does the app match the style of the chosen publication? Are the charts and tables presented in an attractive, effective way that fits the brand? (33.3%)
Story: Did you find an interesting and/or important story in the data and make it clear in the dashboard? (33.3%)
