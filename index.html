                Diversity is more than just a fashionable term thrown around in the buzz of the tech realm. It is the key to innovation and progression, the channel to new and creative ideas. Many benefits can come out of the increase in technically different minds from various, ethnic backgrounds. Unfortunately, the numbers of those employed in tech don't reflect this way.

                <h3>The Gender and Racial Gap</h3>
                <p>If you walk into any tech department chances are you'll find a majority of the workers to follow a common pattern: male and caucasian. Though the biggest tech companies claim to be working at improving their inclusivity in work environments there is still a clear gap in gender and race.</p>
                <p>The graph below shows the distribution of males and females as well as the different racial profiles that were working within the tech field as of 2017. The field is broken down into more specific industries ranging from professional technological services to computer systems design. Out of the <strong>11,764</strong> employees that work in <span class="italics">Professional and Technical Services</span> a staggering <strong>79.6%</strong> of the total workers are white while the other <strong>20.4%</strong> is composed of Asian, Blacks, and Hispanics. In addition to that total, <strong>57.4%</strong> are male while females make up <strong>42.2%</strong> of that population. Based on the graph, it is evident that both minorities and females are still underrepresented, making up less than a quarter of the workforce in the tech industry.</p>

                <h3>Why is there so little diversity in an industry <br/>that is progressing so well?</h3>
                <p>There are many factors that come into play when addressing the issue of the lack in diversity in the tech industry. A few of these factors include: exclusivity, education levels and resources, and inadequate motivation to pursue the subject matter.</p>
                <p>The feeling of being included in a group can transfer to almost any situation, especially in a setting where you're interacting with the same people everyday. We tend to spend more time with the people who share the most similarities with us. Who else could relate to us other than those who share the same culture, values, and beliefs? Thus, a company's culture and the type of people within it will greatly effect a minority's decision to stay or leave. Inevitably, within groups that are predominantly composed of people of a certain "personality" or "character" there will be the feeling of misplacement for a minority in a place where there are less people that you can talk to about your interests, likes, and thoughts.</p>
                <p>Two other important reasons why there are less minorities in this field are the insufficiency of role models for those of color to look up to as well as the low-motivation to pursue the field due to lack of education and resources. Because there are less minorities holding top positions in companies, the motivation isn't as apparent as it would be for those who share the same passion and knowledge for technology as public figures like Bill Gates or Elon Musk. In addition, there are very few educational figures that Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians can talk to directly about resources and advice within the field. The competition in tech is usually overwhelming and intimidation can kick in driving away a lot of potential STEM pursuers. Not having connections to build or improve on knowledge of technology makes it hard for minorities to move upward in mobility.</p>
                <p>The following graph shows the responses from a survey taken from the Pew Research Center. The data showcases the responses from STEM employees of different races who think that certain reasons are why diversity is lacking. As shown from the following graph, the prominent reasons that stand out are: being <span class="italics">less likely to have access to quality education to prepare them for these fields</span>, <span class="italics">discrimination in recruitment, hiring and promotions</span>, and <span class="italics">lack of encouragement at a young age</span>.</p>

                <h3>Why We Need More Diversity</h3>
                    <p>Technology is quickly dominating our society and in ways we wouldn't think twice about. From phone applications that can instantly give feedback on your heart rate to facial recognition technologies to improve security, these inventions wouldn't exist now if it weren't for the pool of creative minds coding behind the computers.</p>
                    <p>Imagine adding more creative minds into that current pool. Minds that think in multiple perspectives because of their upbringings and backgrounds. With a diverse group of people that think in different ways, there is a higher chance of being able to solve problems because of the different angles that each individual can approach and attack from. Being able to listen to new, refreshing insight can solve blocks in workflows and enrich other team members in different methods to approach future problems.
                    <p> Not only would creativity and the degree of problem-solving be enhanced, the business aspect of technology could be improved as well. Tech companies still have to deal with customers or clients on a daily basis and having people of various experiences in interacting with others of diverse background can deem beneficial to a company's expanding network.</p>
                    <p>Overall, diversity and inclusion has so much potential in benefitting the tech industry. Unfortunately, throughout these past few years, the gender and racial gaps seem to sit at a standstill even though there have been active movements to bridge those gaps. As we continue to fix the division between genders and race in the the tech industry, we should bring out the benefits of grouping together these individuals who have different interests and opinions but strong aspirations to make a difference in their community and a passion for technology. We must shed light on the possibilities of how this mixture can rise technology to new heights.</p>
