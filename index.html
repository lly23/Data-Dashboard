                Diversity is more than just a fashionable term thrown around in the buzz of the tech realm. It is the key to innovation and progression, the channel to new and creative ideas. Many benefits can come out of the increase in technically different minds from various, ethnic backgrounds. Unfortunately, the numbers of those employed in tech don't reflect this way.

                <h3>The Gender and Racial Gap</h3>
                <p>If you walk into any tech department chances are you'll find a majority of the workers to follow a common pattern: male and caucasian. Though the biggest tech companies claim to be working at improving their inclusivity in work environments there is still a clear gap in gender and race.</p>
                <p>The graph below shows the distribution of males and females as well as the different racial profiles that are working within the tech field as of 2017. The field is broken down into more specific industries ranging from professional technological services to computer systems design. Out of the <strong>18,835</strong> employees that work in <span class="italics">Professional and Technical Services</span> a staggering <strong>78.5%</strong> of the total workers are white while <strong>57.8%</strong> of that total are male. Based on the graph, it is evident that minorities are still underrepresented, making up less than a quarter of the workforce in the tech industry.</p>

                <h3>Why is there so little diversity in an industry <br/>that is progressing so well?</h3>
                <p>There are many factors that come into play when addressing the issue of the lack in diversity in the tech industry. A few of these factors include: exclusivity, education level, and a source of inspiration to pursue the subject matter.</p>
                <p>The feeling of being included in a group can transfer to almost any situation, especially at a work place setting where you're interacting with the same people everyday. We tend to spend more time with the people who share the most similarities with us. Who else could relate to us other than those who share the same culture, values, and beliefs? Therefore, a minority will inevitably feel left out and a feeling of being misplaced within the "culture fit" of that company.</p>
                <p>Another important reason to bring up is the insufficiency of role models for minorities to look up to in a professional setting. </p>
                <p>The following graph shows the responses from a survey taken from the Pew Research Center. The data showcases the responses from STEM employees of different races who think that certain reasons are why diversity is lacking. As shown from the following graph, a few prominent reasons that stand out are: being <span class="italics">less likely to have access to quality education to prepare them for these fields</span>, <span class="italics">discrimination in recruitment, hiring and promotions</span>, and <span class="italics">lack of encouragement at a young age</span>.</p>

                <h3>Why We Need More Diversity</h3>
                    <p>Technology is quickly dominating our society and in ways we wouldn't think twice about. From phone applications that can instantly give feedback on your heart rate to facial recognition technologies to improve security, these inventions wouldn't exist now if it weren't for the pool of creative minds coding behind the computers.</p>
                    <p>Multiple perspectives in solving situations based on upbringings and backgrounds.</p>
                    We can find technology anywhere. Whether it's an application on your smartphone or the , everywhere you go there is bound to be a piece of technology providing us with services and functionalities that we wouldn't think twice about.
